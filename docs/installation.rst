Brief information
==========================

Before you begin
--------------------------
Unlike many other PODBot flavours, YaPB is able to run as metamod plugin as well as standalone dll for every platform it supports (except Android) without changing so/dll/dylib. 

.. Important:: If you have some mods like AMX Mod X installed, you should consider installing bots as a metamod plugin, not as standalone dll. In other situations there is **no** requirement to install metamod before installing YaPB.

Installation docs only cover installing bot on genuine Steam version of Counter-Strike. Assuming that if you run something special, you know how to install bot as standalone dll or as metamod plugin.

.. Note:: Only 32-bit binary is available, since Valve has dropped support for 64-bit HLDS.


Installing bot on Windows
==========================
YaPB supports installing both on listen and dedicated server under Windows. Many people are using it as their main operating system, so the bot has a simple installer, that could assist you in adding bots to game. If you don't want to install manually, please use an installer.

Installing using setup program
--------------------------
- Download the latest YaPB bot installer from https://yapb.jeefo.net/latest (example: ``yapb-4.4.957-windows.exe``)
- Run program.
- Press ``Browse`` and point to where ``hl.exe``/``hlds.exe`` is located.
- Press ``Install`` to install bot.
- You're done!

.. Important:: Installer program automatically detects whether you use metamod, and will patch ``plugins.ini`` file automatically for you, adding entry to point to ``yapb.dll``. If there is no metamod, installer will patch the ``liblist.gam`` file to point to ``yapb.dll``

.. Caution:: Installer has a feature for detecting Counter-Strike game folders. It's looks up all directories where selected ``hl.exe``/``hlds.exe`` is located and checks the library for containing export symbols ``weapon_ak47`` and ``weapon_m4a1``, and if so assuming that this folder contains some Counter-Strike version, it will install bot to this directory automatically.

Installing without metamod

Installing bot on macOS
==========================
YaPB can be installed on listen servers only if you use macOS.

.. Note:: macOS support is deprecated. YaPB binary moved to extras package and is located in the ``darwin-x86`` folder.

.. Note:: There is unofficial binary called ``hlds_osx`` provided by AlliedModders LLC allowing you to run HLDS under macOS. You can try download it here_.

.. _here: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2041538&postcount=11

.. Note:: Valve didn't update GoldSrc games to support macOS Catalina, and Apple has dropped 32-bit support, so Counter-Strike isn't playable on latest macOS releases. YaPB still provides binaries for pre-Catalina users. As soon as Valve (if ever) release Counter-Strike for macOS Catalina, YaPB 64-bit binaries will be available.
