******************************
Configuring the Bot
******************************
Bot CVARS are located inside yapb.cfg and parsed on every level change. So new config will be applied on map change or by issuing ``exec addons/yapb/conf/yapb.cfg`` inside the server console.

CVARs can be changed on the fly by typing them into the console.

Map specific configs where user-configured cvars are stored. The filename is ``mapname.cfg`` where "mapname" is name of the map for which this config was created eg: ``de_dust.cfg`` for de_dust map. This file located at ``addons/yapb/conf/maps`` directory.

You can use the cvars shown above to write in this config. They will be executed automatically when you start a map specified in the name of this config.

By default YaPB does not have any configs for maps.

Custom Configuration File
================================
A custom config file that allows you to change some hard-coded things in the bot code.

It's located in ``addons/yapb/conf/custom.cfg``

``C4ModelName`` - It sets a custom name for C4 model, for servers that replace C4 model with it's own.
By default it's ``c4.mdl`` (the models/path is omitted), so if you need to use ``models/mybomb/mybomb.mdl``, you should specify ``mybomb/mybomb.mdl``.

``AMXParachuteCvar`` - It sets a custom cvar name for parachute handling, there are various plugins that handles parachute (AMX Parachute, AMX Parachute Lite, etc.), you can specify needed cvar here.

``CustomCSDMSpawnPoint`` - It sets a custom spawn point classname for CSDM mods that add custom spawn points other than info_player_start and info_player_deathmatch. So bots will be able to join the game without default spawn entities.


Bot Difficulty Configuration
================================
You can fine-tune the bots thanks to the difficulty configuration file.
It contains the values of reaction time, headshot and wallshot probabilities, recoil control values, and aim offset axes.

Each of these values is tied to each difficulty level.

The bots difficulty configuration file is located on the path ``addons/yapb/conf/difficulty.cfg``

The valid format is::

    Level = minReactionTime(s),maxReactionTime(s),headshotProbability,seenThruWallChance,heardThruWallChance,maxWeaponRecoil,aimError

Where::
    
    minReactionTime - Minimal time in seconds from when the bot first saw the enemy to when it can recognize it.
    maxReactionTime - Same as above, but upper cap of the limit.
    headshotProbability - The probability that the bot will aim at the head instead of body, if both body and head are visible.
    seenThruWallChance - Chance that the bot will attack the enemy if it believes that it is there and just saw it.
    heardThruWallChance - Chance that the bot will attack the enemy if it believes that it is there and just heard it.
    maxWeaponRecoil - Maximum weapon recoil to compensate by pausing fire.
    aimError - (x, y, z) offsets to add aim error to bot aiming


Example::

    Expert = 0.1, 0.2, 100, 90, 90, 21, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0

Logos Configuration
================================
List of the bot spray paints are stored is in ``addons/yapb/conf/logos.cfg``.
It uses textures from decals.wad, so if you want to add a new spray paint texture, it should be in that file.
To see available textures in decals.wad you can use special tools like Wally, Half-Life Texture Tools, etc.

Default spray paints list::

    {biohaz
    {graf003
    {graf004
    {graf005
    {lambda06
    {target
    {hand1
    {spit2
    {bloodhand6
    {foot_l
    {foot_r

Weapons Configuration
================================
Main config where most stuff regarding weapon handling is defined. The filename is ``weapon.cfg`` and located at ``addons/yapb/conf`` directory.

To edit this file you need to know the weapon numbering.

MapStandard Field
----------------------------
This field is by default used on all maps except VIP scenario.

Below is the table that specifies which Team is allowed to buy a weapon on a Map. You can also use it to allow/disallow Weapons for a Team or a Map/Gamemode (remember that some Weapons are team-specific and can't be bought by another team).

Weapon buy flags::

    -1 = Disallow Buying for any Team
    0 = Terrorist Team only
    1 = CT Team only
    2 = Can be bought by both Teams

Example::

    MapStandard = -1,0,-1,2,-1,0,1,2,2,2,-1,2,-1,-1,0,0,1,0,1,1,2,2,0,1,2,1

MapAS Field
----------------------------
This field is by default used only on VIP scenario maps.

Below is the table that specifies which Team is allowed to buy a weapon on a Map. You can also use it to allow/disallow Weapons for a Team or a Map/Gamemode (remember that some Weapons are team-specific and can't be bought by another team).

Weapon buy flags::

    -1 = Disallow Buying for any Team
    0 = Terrorist Team only
    1 = CT Team only
    2 = Can be bought by both Teams

Example::

    MapAS = -1,-1,-1,2,-1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,0,-1,1,0,1,1,0,0,-1,1,1,1

    25 - SHIELD

From left to right. Rightmost value is a most wanted bot weapon. Leftmost value is most worst weapon.

.. Note:: Knife should most "worst" weapon in this table, otherwise things are messed up.

Examples::

    PersonalityNormal = 00,02,01,04,05,06,03,12,10,24,25,13,11,08,07,22,23,20,21,09,19,15,17,18,14,16
